# FAQ

## What is Notion?

### It's Volta!

## What is Volta?

### It's a tool formerly called Notion!

## But what _is_ Volta?

I'll let them [answer that](https://volta.sh/). They're really good at that part.

## Why am I reading this?

Who knows?? (that's kind of the point) Maybe you came here from one of the [100+ issues](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/issues?q=is%3Aissue+notion+is%3Aclosed) that still mention "notion" with no context about what it is or use it interchangeably with "volta". Maybe you found your way here after following a link from an old blog post talking about "notion" and landed on a page called "volta". Or maybe you came here from a Google search after not finding any reference to "notion" in the readme as it is an "[irrelevant detail that would cause confusion](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/issues/1013#issuecomment-916884631)".

Either way, you're here!

## So should I use Volta?

Absolutely! It's amazing! Well ok, if I'm being honest the interface is a bit [wonky](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta/issues/855) (on reflection maybe that's not unrelated) but overall it's a wonderful tool I use all the time!

## What's your problem?

Let's just say that I have a bee in my bonnet about developer documentation. Developers provide hundreds of thousands of tools, libraries, and frameworks with incredible features all _for free_. And yet 95% of the time the documentation is either head-bangingly frustrating or nonexistent altogether. We can do better.

To be clear, Volta's documentation is great. In fact it's amazing considering the competition. However they feel that fundamental questions that may arise about their project (like for example, its name) are "minor details that may cause confusion". That's not how any of this works.

Our software does not exist in a bubble. You may be a veteran software engineer, but someone approaching your project could be literally anyone arriving with any level of experience, any number of questions in their head, and any kind of understanding (or misunderstanding) of what your software is and how it is used.

If you are a developer and haven't read [this book](https://www.sensible.com/dont-make-me-think/) it should be top on your reading list. If you have read it, read it again but this time when you see "website" replace it with "your project". Good documentation is no different from building a website. Your users are not going to sit down with a cup of coffee and read your beautiful prose from start to finish like a novel. They have specific questions they need answered and your job is to surface the answers in a sensible way while providing a grounded understanding of what your project _is_ and what it _is not_.

Think about it: did you read this entire page? Or did you just "get the gist" then scan it to see if it had anything real to say? Have you ever wondered why you get so many issues opened for things clearly written in the third paragraph of your docs? Is it that these people are all stupid? Maybe... but maybe it's that you're not understanding how they are approaching your software.

While I'm on the subject, this applies to your API as well, which is in a sense an extension of your documentation. If users are constantly opening issues because it isn't clear simply from the interface how your software is used then _you're doing it wrong_.

So many of us make incredible things that benefit many people, developers and end users alike. But making it intuitive, clear, and easy to use is the only way it will ever reach people. Let's make sure we get it right.
